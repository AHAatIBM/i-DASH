# i-DASH
Repository for i-DASH, a GBS asset for performing assessments on IBM i Systems.
IBM i clients are increasingly hampered by the density and complexity of their legacy applications.  And as COVID-19 has demonstrated, every organization, from a local government agency to an international bank, needs an application environment that lets them pivot on a dime.  IBMâ€™s i-DASH is an agile, cost-effective service that gives IBM i clients immediate insights into their applications and systems, allowing them to make faster, more informed decisions on respond to change in a highly volatile business environment.
This repository describes the tooling and services that the GBS Modernize for Cloud team can deliver through any organization in IBM.  We can provide this services completely remotely or on site when possible.
This offerings consists of the following elements:
  1. Extract metadata from client system.  Using a fully automated script, which can be run by either Client personnel or remotely by IBM, we extract information about the system configuration, database model, and applications running on the system.  Note that we do not extract actual data, but rather the descriptors about the data.
  2. Upload the results to a SaaS analytics tool. This can be completely automated, or the client can send us the extraction file and we will manually upload to the cloud.
  3. Interpret the results and report back to the client.  This step requires the skills and epxerience of the Modernize for Cloud team.  We can deliver the results remotely, or in person when possible.
  
The total time required to conduct this assessment is one to two weeks.  We deliver very meaningful and actionable insights at a much lower cost than a traditional discovery.
